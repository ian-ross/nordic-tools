# The judging criteria

## Installation

**How easy is it to install the platform?**

**Is the download ridiculously large? How much disk space do you
need?**

**Does it work on Linux? Windows? MacOS? Any weird restrictions?**

**Is it free?**

## Quick start

**How long is "Zero To Blinky"?**

**Are there enough examples?**

**Does stuff just work?**

## Documentation

**Is there any?**

**Is there enough?**

**Is it any good? (i.e. not just Doxygen...)**

**Are there tutorials? Examples? Pictures? Performance data?**

## Basic workflow

### Edit

**Is there editor syntax support?**

**Do you have to use a specific IDE or can you use tools you're
 already familiar with?**

**If you have to use a specific IDE, is it any good?**

### Compile

**How easy is setting up paths to headers and libraries?**

**What are compiler error messages like?**

**Any extras (like warnings of potential power problems or things like
that)?**

### Flash

**Basically, does it work?**

### Debug

**What's the source level debugging like?**

**What are register and peripheral data views like?**

**Do breakpoints, watchpoints, etc. work? (I don't use these things a
   lot, but when you need them, you need them, so it's nice to know
   that they're there.)**

## Fancy workflows

**Command line builds: how easy are they to set up? are they possible
at all?**

**Testing: any special support?**

**Continuous integration: any special support?**

## Functionality

### Coverage of device functionality

**What device peripherals have driver libraries?**

**Are those libraries easy to use?**

**Are there any options missing?**

**If so, how easy is it to work around?**

### Configuration

**How easy is it to use different libraries or drivers in your code?**

**Are there any configuration or code generation tools to help with
the setup?**

### Libraries

**Are there higher-level libraries available for common functionality
 (e.g. communications, crypto, etc.)?**

**How easy is it to incorporate third-party code into your projects?**

### Frustration

**Basically: Did implementing the test programs make Ian angry?**
